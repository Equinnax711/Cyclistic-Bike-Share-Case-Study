# Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Case-Study

###Problem Statement
Cyclistic, a successful bike-share company, launched in 2016, slowly expanding across Chicago and gaining revenue. Within Cyclistic’s business model, there are various pricing plans that customers can choose to purchase. 

The single-ride pass, full-day pass, and annual membership. Based on Cyclistic’s finance analysts, customers that purchase the annual membership are much more profitable than those that choose the single and full day passes. Therefore, in order for Cyclistic to generate more revenue and further grow, Cyclistic must figure out how to convert those casual riders to annual riders. This can be done by analyzing the differences between the current casual and annual riders. Looking at this data will allow Cyclistic to make an informed decision on how to maximize revenue in the near future.

###Data Security & Organization
The data is located on Cyclistic’s historical trip data website, from which we can download the data file. It is organized in an excel csv format, with data columns for unique ride-ids, type of bike ridden, ride-start and ride end time, start location names and ids, end-locations names and ids, starting and ending latitude and longitude numbers, and member status. There are no issues with credibility within this dataset because no rides have been omitted from the data. It represents the census of cyclistic rides, removing the chance of sampling bias or the chance that the dataset is not representative of the entire population. 

Because this data has been made publicly available under the LLC data license agreement, we are able to use it without penalty or accessibility concerns. Data such as personal identification and credit card numbers have not been included within this dataset in order to protect and respect the rider’s right to privacy.

To make sure that this dataset is ready for merging, cleaning, and analysis, we'll first have to ensure that all columns match up correctly. This includes renaming columns, rerouting data, and ensuring datatypes are consistent within each quarterly period to maintain an organized standard structure.
